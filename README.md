# Loan Default Prediction Model
This model was developed to predict if a loan will be paid back or not.
In this notebook, I applied classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours, decision tree, support vector machines and logistic regression after which the best classifier for this specific dataset was selected using accuracy evaluation methods.
