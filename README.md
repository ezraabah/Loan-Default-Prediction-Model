# Loan Default Prediction Model
This model was developed to predict if a loan will be paid back or not.
Using classification algorithms, a model can be created to not only automate the prediction process but to do so at a high accuracy. In this notebook, I applying classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours, decision tree, support vector machines and logistic regression after which the best classifier for this specific dataset was selected using accuracy evaluation methods.
